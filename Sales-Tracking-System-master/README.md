Sales Tracking System

Problem Statement 

As a group of software engineers with a company that sells plant repair services via a network of sales people, you are tasked to build a new system that enables the sales force to record their quotes via the Internet. The system will maintain a database of sales people, handle the recording of sales quotes, establish and fulfill purchase orders. The system will also assign sales commissions for the sales person.

A sales person is presented with a custom quote tracking program which can be run anywhere on a Internet platform. After the sales person logs in (s)he can enter sales quotes for customers. Quotes are entered for existing customers, their information is maintained in a company legacy database with customer name, address, and contact info (details provided later). A quote consists of line items of description each with a price. The sales person is free to enter whatever. The quote is entered into a new quote database. The sales person can also attach secret notes to any quote. The sales person also attaches an e-mail address to the quote, which is used as e-mail destination for delivery once the quote is sanctioned

The second interface to the system runs in-house at the headquarters on a Windows platform: quotes can be retrieved, and adjusted, prices can be changed, line items added or removed, discounts can be given. The secret notes added by the sales person can be reviewed, and new ones added. The quotes are updated in the quote database: either left unresolved, or sanctioned. Sanctioned quotes are considered complete and sent out via e-mail. The quote status is updated.

The third interface (also in-house) allows to convert a quote into a purchase order once the customer has indicated to go ahead with the order. At this time a final discount can be entered. The purchase order is then sent to a processing system (details provided later) which answers with a confirmation number and a sales commission rate for the sales person. The commission is computed and stored for the sales person.

And lastly, there will be an administrative interface that maintains information about the sales people: name, user id, password, accumulated commission, address, etc. and other global parameters as needed.
